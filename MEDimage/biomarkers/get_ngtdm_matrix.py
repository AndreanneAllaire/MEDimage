    """Computes NGTDM matrix.

    This function computes the Neighborhood Gray-Tone Difference Matrix
    (NGTDM) of the region of interest (ROI) of an input volume. The input
    volume is assumed to be isotropically resampled. The NGTDM is computed
    using 26-voxel connectivity. To account for discretization length
    differences, all averages around a center voxel are performed such that
    the neighbours at a distance of sqrt(3) voxels are given a weight of
    1/sqrt(3), and the neighbours at a distance of sqrt(2) voxels are given a
    weight of 1/sqrt(2).

    Note:
        This function is compatible with 2D analysis (language not adapted in the text)

    Args:
        roi_only (ndarray): Smallest box containing the ROI, with the imaging data ready
            for texture analysis computations. Voxels outside the ROI are set to NaNs.
        levels (ndarray): Vector containing the quantized gray-levels in the tumor region
            (or reconstruction levels of quantization).
        distCorrection (str, optional): Set this variable to true in order to use
            discretization length difference corrections as used 
            here: https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/60/14/5471.
            Set this variable to false to replicate IBSI results.

    Returns:
        Tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]: 
            - NGTDM: Neighborhood Gray-Tone Difference Matrix of 'roi_only'.
            - count_valid: Array of number of valid voxels used in the NGTDM computation.
