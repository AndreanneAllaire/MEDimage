    DESCRIPTION:
    This function computes the Gray-Level Co-occurence Matrix (GLCM) of the
    region of interest (ROI) of an input volume. The input volume is assumed
    to be isotropically resampled. Only one GLCM is computed per scan,
    simultaneously recording (i.e. adding up) the neighboring properties of
    the 26-connected neighbors of all voxels in the ROI. To account for
    discretization length differences, neighbors at a distance of sqrt(3)
    voxels around a center voxel increment the GLCM by a value of sqrt(3),
    neighbors at a distance of sqrt(2) voxels around a center voxel increment
    the GLCM by a value of sqrt(2), and neighbors at a distance of 1 voxels
    around a center voxel increment the GLCM by a value of 1.

    --> This function is compatible with 2D analysis
    (language not adapted in the text).

    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INPUTS:
    - ROIonly: Smallest box containing the ROI, with the imaging data ready
               for texture analysis computations. Voxels outside the ROI are
               set to NaNs.
    - levels: Vector containing the quantized gray-levels in the tumor region
              (or reconstruction levels of quantization).
    - distCorrection: (optional). Set this variable to true in order to use
                      discretization length difference corrections as used
                      here: https://doi.org/10.1088/0031-9155/60/14/5471.
                      Set this variable to false to replicate IBSI results.

    ** 'ROIonly' and 'levels' should be outputs from 'prepareVolume.m' **
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    OUTPUTS:
    - GLCM: Gray-Level Co-occurence Matrix of 'ROIOnly'.
