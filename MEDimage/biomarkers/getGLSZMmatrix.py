    """Compute GLSZMmatrix.

    This function computes the Gray-Level Size Zone Matrix (GLSZM) of the
    region of interest (ROI) of an input volume. The input volume is assumed
    to be isotropically resampled. The zones of different sizes are computed
    using 26-voxel connectivity.

    Note:
        This function is compatible with 2D analysis (language not adapted in the text).

    Args:
        ROIOnlyInt (ndarray): Smallest box containing the ROI, with the imaging data ready
            for texture analysis computations. Voxels outside the ROI are
            set to NaNs.
        levels (ndarray or List): Vector containing the quantized gray-levels 
            in the tumor region (or reconstruction levels of quantization).

    Returns:
        ndarray: Array of Gray-Level Size Zone Matrix of 'ROIOnly'.
