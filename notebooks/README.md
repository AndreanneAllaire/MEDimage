# MEDimage demo, ibsi tests and tutorials

We have made many notebooks available in this folder to clear the way for the use of the package. In order to run these notebooks you must have the right datasets for each notebook. To easily do so, run the following command from the parent folder:

```
python scripts/download_data.py
```

This command will download and organize the dataset for you in the right folders.

## ibsi folder

The *ibsi* folder contains notebooks and other assets for all the IBSI tests.

## demo folder

The *demo* folder contains one notebook that demonstrates in a brief way the different use cases of the package with a single scan.

## tutorials folder

The *tutorials* folder contains notebooks explaining the use of ``DataManager``,  ``MEDimage`` and ``BatchExtractor`` classes, these three classes highly participate in the functioning of the package so we recommend taking the time to follow the tutorials.
