# MEDimage demo, ibsi tests and tutorials

We have made many notebooks available in this folder to clear the way for the use of the package.

## ibsi folder

The *ibsi* folder contains notebooks and other assets for all the IBSI tests.

## demo folder

The *demo* folder contains one notebook that demonstrates in a brief way the different use cases of the package with a single scan.

## tutorials folder

The *tutorials* folder contains notebooks explaining the use of ``DataManager`` and ``BatchExtractor`` classes, these two classes highly participate in the functioning of the package so we recommend taking the time to well understand how they function.
